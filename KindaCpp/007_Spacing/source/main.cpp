 * However, this code is almost completely unreadable.

 * For example, when writing functions like main(), some people do this
 * 
 *      int main() {
 *          return 0;
 *      }
 * 
 * some do this
 * 
 *      int main()
 *      {
 * `        return 0;
 *      }
 * 
 * sr if the code is short, some people do this
 * 
 *      int main() { return 0; }
 *      
 * It is merely a matter of styles.
 * Personally, I barely use the first format, because I think it is hard for myself to read that.
 * Anyway, you do you.
